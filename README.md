# Logistic Regression with a Neural Network 🪄

## Description 📖
### This project implements a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats in images. The main tasks include:

### 1. Building the general architecture of a learning algorithm:
* Initializing parameters
* Calculating the cost function and its gradient
* Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent)

### 2. Combining all three functions into a main model function, in the correct order.
<br>To run: `Logistic_Regression.py`

## Getting Started 🚀

## Prerequisites 🐍
Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed on your machine. In addition to the following packages:
* `numpy`
* `h5py`
* `PIL`
* `scipy`
* `matplotlib`

## Dataset 🗳️
The dataset (`data.h5`) contains:
* A training set of images labeled as cat (y=1) or non-cat (y=0)
* A test set of images labeled as cat or non-cat
* Each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) where 3 represents the RGB channels.

## File Structure 🗂️
* `lr_utils.py`: Contains the load_dataset function to load the data.
* `public_tests.py`: Contains test functions for validating each step of the implementation.


## Features ✨
1. Sigmoid Function
2. Initialize Parameters
3. Forward and Backward Propagation
4. Optimization
5. Prediction
6. Model
